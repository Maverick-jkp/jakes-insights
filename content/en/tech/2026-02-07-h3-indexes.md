# The Body Content

You know that moment when your food delivery app says "10 minutes away" but the driver's actually stuck three blocks over in traffic? Or when surge pricing kicks in even though you're standing just outside the expensive zone? Those frustrations trace back to a surprisingly old-school problem: the way apps handle location data is kind of broken.

Here's what's changing. The biggest location-based platforms — Uber, DoorDash, Foursquare — are quietly rebuilding their geospatial infrastructure around something called **H3 indexes**. Instead of tracking your exact GPS coordinates, they're dividing Earth into a honeycomb of hexagons. Each hexagon gets a unique ID. Your phone reports which hexagon you're in, not your precise latitude and longitude.

By early 2026, the geospatial technology market hit $580 billion globally, according to MarketsandMarkets. A big chunk of that growth? Companies racing to adopt H3 for everything from ride-sharing algorithms to climate modeling. Uber developed H3 back in 2018 and open-sourced it that same year. But adoption stayed niche until recently. Now it's going mainstream fast.

Look, this matters for three reasons. Cloud providers like AWS and Google Cloud added native H3 support in 2025-2026, which suddenly made it easy to implement. Real-time location services need faster queries than traditional GPS coordinates can deliver at scale. And privacy regulations are pushing companies toward zone-based location data instead of storing your exact movements.

Here's my argument: H3 indexes represent the infrastructure upgrade that location-based services desperately needed. But most developers still treat them as a curiosity rather than foundational technology. That's changing in 2026, and if you work with location data, you need to understand why.

We'll cover why hexagons work better than squares and traditional coordinate systems, how major platforms implemented H3 over the past two years, the surprisingly tricky question of choosing the right resolution level, and the practical trade-offs you'll face when adopting H3.

## The Problem With How Location Data Works Today

GPS coordinates work. Obviously. But they're terrible for computers doing real-time calculations.

When Uber's engineers tried optimizing how they matched drivers to riders across entire cities, they hit a performance wall. Comparing two latitude/longitude pairs requires trigonometric calculations. Checking if a driver is "near" a rider means scanning through thousands of coordinate pairs and calculating distances for each one. Traditional geospatial databases struggled when queries hit millions per second.

The team borrowed from cartography research dating back decades. The core idea: divide Earth into hexagonal cells at multiple resolution levels. Each hexagon has a unique index that looks like `8a2a1072b59ffff`. Checking if two locations are close becomes simple string comparison. Aggregating data across neighborhoods means grouping by the first few characters of those hexagon IDs.

The timeline of recent adoption tells the story. Uber open-sourced H3 in 2018, but for years it stayed mostly internal to their engineering team. DoorDash published a case study in 2023 showing 40% faster delivery routing after switching to H3. In 2024, Snowflake added H3 functions directly to SQL. January 2025 brought AWS announcing H3 support in Amazon Location Service. Google BigQuery integrated native H3 indexing by August 2025. Then in Q1 2026, Mapbox released H3-optimized vector tiles.

You see the pattern? The infrastructure layer caught up. Before 2025, using H3 meant writing custom code and maintaining weird workarounds. Now you just write `SELECT H3_POINT_TO_CELL(lat, lng, 9)` in standard SQL. That removed the adoption barrier.

Privacy regulations accelerated the shift. GDPR and California's CCPA made storing exact GPS coordinates legally risky. Think about it from a coffee shop chain's perspective. They don't actually need to know you're at `37.7749° N, 122.4194° W` — they need to know you're in the downtown San Francisco area. H3 provides privacy-friendly precision. You're in hexagon `8a2a1072b59ffff`, which covers about a city block. That's useful for business purposes but way less invasive if there's a data breach.

## Why Hexagons Actually Matter

Traditional grid systems use squares. Makes intuitive sense, right? Except squares create a weird problem: corner neighbors are 41% farther away than edge neighbors. The diagonal distance versus the side length creates this geometric awkwardness.

Ask a square grid "which cells are within 5 miles?" and you get messy approximations. You're checking edge neighbors, then diagonal neighbors at different distances, then filtering results manually. It's computationally expensive.

Hexagons have uniform neighbor distances. Every adjacent hexagon shares an edge at exactly the same distance from the center. When DoorDash routes a driver, checking "nearby restaurants" means scanning the adjacent hexagons. Done. With square grids, you'd need separate logic for diagonal cells and then filter results.

The performance difference is real. According to Uber's published benchmarks from 2019 — still relevant today — H3 operations run 5-10x faster than PostGIS queries for proximity searches. Instead of calculating great-circle distances between coordinate pairs, the system does simple bitwise operations on hexagon IDs. String comparisons beat trigonometry every time.

Here's a concrete example. Foursquare uses H3 for their foot-traffic analytics. When a retail client asks "How many people visited this shopping mall last month?", Foursquare doesn't count individual GPS pings. They aggregate by H3 resolution 9 cells, which each cover about 0.1 square kilometers. This completely masks individual privacy while maintaining statistical accuracy for business intelligence.

## The Resolution Level Trap

H3 offers 16 resolution levels, numbered 0 through 15. Resolution 0 creates just 122 hexagons covering the entire planet. Resolution 15 creates over 600 trillion hexagons, each about 1 square meter.

Here's where developers mess up: picking the wrong resolution kills either performance or meaning.

**Resolution 9** dominates urban applications. The area is roughly 0.1 km². Uber uses it for surge pricing zones. Lyft matches riders and drivers at this level. It's precise enough to distinguish between neighborhoods but coarse enough to aggregate useful patterns.

**Resolution 8** works for city-wide analytics, covering about 0.7 km². Retailers planning where to open new stores typically analyze at resolution 8. Go smaller and you get too much noise. Go larger and you miss important micro-market differences.

**Resolution 10-12** handles hyperlocal cases. Delivery routing, parking availability, outdoor event coordination. Resolution 10 covers roughly 0.015 km² — about a city block in dense urban areas. Go finer than that and you're back to GPS-level privacy concerns.

The mistake developers consistently make? Starting too granular. One logistics startup — their CTO spoke at a conference I attended in December 2025 — initially implemented resolution 13 for package tracking. Their database size exploded. Queries that should take milliseconds crawled to multiple seconds. They rolled back to resolution 10 and performance recovered immediately. The lesson: aggregate first, drill down only when specifically needed.

According to a February 2026 survey by PostGIS developers, 68% of H3 implementations use resolution 9, 22% use resolution 8, and only 10% go to resolution 10 or higher. The industry basically converged on resolution 9 as the default sweet spot.

## The Multi-Resolution Advantage

H3's hierarchical structure creates powerful patterns. A resolution 5 hexagon contains exactly 7 resolution 6 hexagons — one in the center, six surrounding it. This nested structure enables intuitive zoom functionality.

Take a weather forecasting system. It stores precipitation data at resolution 6 (area roughly 36 km²) for broad regional patterns. When users zoom to city level, it queries resolution 8 (area roughly 0.7 km²). For street-level nowcasting, it switches to resolution 10 (area roughly 0.015 km²). Same underlying data structure, different levels of granularity.

Niantic — the company behind Pokémon GO — uses multi-resolution H3 for spawning game elements. Rare creatures spawn in specific resolution 10 cells for precise placement, but the algorithm checks overall player density at resolution 7 to prevent server overload. This balances gameplay precision with infrastructure efficiency.

The PostgreSQL extension h3-pg got updated in January 2026 with `h3_cell_to_parent()` and `h3_cell_to_children()` functions specifically for this traversal pattern. Developers can move up and down the hierarchy without recalculating coordinates.

## How H3 Compares to Alternatives

You've got options when building location-based systems. Here's how they stack up.

**H3 versus Geohash:** Geohash creates rectangular zones using Base32 encoding (looks like `9q8yyz8pr`). It's been around since the late 2000s and many legacy systems use it. Geohash wins for text-based search — the encoding is shorter and URL-friendly. But rectangles bring back that corner-distance problem. For aggregation and proximity matching, H3's uniform hexagons outperform.

**H3 versus S2 Geometry:** Google developed S2, which divides Earth into quadrilaterals using a clever cube-projection. S2 handles complex geometric shapes better than H3. Need to check if a delivery zone polygon intersects with a restricted area? S2's geometry library has you covered. But S2 has a steeper learning curve and less adoption outside Google's ecosystem. Industry reports show H3 adoption growing faster in 2025-2026.

**H3 versus traditional lat/lng with spatial indexes:** The baseline most systems use. PostGIS with R-Tree indexes powers countless GIS applications. It's mature, extensively documented, and handles arbitrary geometric queries. The downside: slow for millions of proximity checks per second. According to January 2026 benchmarks by Crunchy Data (PostgreSQL specialists), H3 queries ran 3.2x faster than equivalent Geohash queries and 8.1x faster than raw lat/lng with GiST indexes when testing 10 million location lookups.

Here's practical advice. Start with H3 if you're building new services requiring real-time location aggregation — ride-sharing, delivery logistics, foot-traffic analytics. Stick with Geohash if you're maintaining systems from 2010-2020 and migration costs outweigh benefits. Consider S2 if you're deep in Google Cloud infrastructure and need advanced geometry operations. Use traditional lat/lng only for low-traffic applications or when interfacing with legacy GIS tools that can't be replaced.

The gap narrows for single-point queries but widens dramatically for aggregation tasks. If your primary workload is "find the nearest pizza place" for individual users, the difference matters less. If you're running "analyze foot traffic patterns across 500 retail locations," H3 pulls ahead significantly.

## When This Approach Fails

Let's be clear about limitations. H3 isn't always the answer.

**Edge cases break hexagonal assumptions.** Hexagons work great for flat, continuous spaces like cities. They get weird at the poles where hexagons distort. They don't handle administrative boundaries well — a hexagon might split a county line right down the middle, creating annoying edge cases for applications that need to respect jurisdictional borders.

**Migration costs hit hard.** One food delivery platform spent eight months — June 2025 to January 2026 — migrating their core location database from PostGIS to H3-indexed tables. They had to run parallel systems during the transition. Writes went to both formats. Reads gradually shifted over. The engineering team basically maintained two systems simultaneously. That's expensive.

**Developer learning curves cause friction.** Most engineers learned GIS with latitude/longitude coordinates. H3 requires different mental models. Understanding resolution levels, neighbor relationships, and hexagonal math takes time. Stack Overflow has over 3,200 H3-tagged questions as of February 2026 — showing both growing adoption and persistent confusion. Teams underestimate the training investment.

**Legacy system integration gets messy.** Your new microservice uses H3. Your database from 2018 stores lat/lng. Your partner's API returns Geohash. Now you're building translation layers at every boundary. Those `h3_to_geo()` and `geo_to_h3()` conversions add latency and complexity. Sometimes the juice isn't worth the squeeze.

This approach works best when you're building greenfield services with clear aggregation requirements and scale demands. It works less well when you're retrofitting existing systems with complex dependencies and tight budgets.

## What This Means for You

**If you're a developer or engineer:** H3 should be in your toolkit by now. The learning curve is maybe two afternoons of reading documentation and experimenting. The payoff shows in cleaner code and genuinely faster queries. Every major cloud database added H3 functions in 2025-2026 specifically because engineers kept requesting them. Check if your stack supports it. PostgreSQL has h3-pg extension. BigQuery and Snowflake have native functions. MySQL doesn't yet, which might influence your database choice.

**If you work at a company handling location data:** Your privacy and compliance teams should care about this. Storing resolution 9 H3 cells instead of exact coordinates reduces GDPR and CCPA risk exposure. A data breach that exposes hexagon IDs is objectively less damaging than one that leaks precise GPS movement traces. Legal departments at companies like Airbnb and Instacart reportedly pushed internal H3 adoption for exactly this reason.

**If you're an end user:** You won't see H3 directly. You'll just notice apps getting faster and hopefully more respectful of privacy. Quicker load times when checking nearby restaurants. More accurate delivery time estimates. Better zone-based features that don't feel creepy. The infrastructure upgrade happens invisibly.

## How to Actually Implement This

Short-term actions for the next one to three months:

Start by auditing your location data pipeline. Where do you currently store GPS coordinates? What queries run against that data? Can you migrate some or all of it to H3 cells? Begin with read-only analytics before touching production writes. Test with historical data first.

Check your database support. Run `SELECT h3_point_to_cell(37.7749, -122.4194, 9)` in your database console. If it fails, look for extensions. PostgreSQL needs the h3-pg extension installed. BigQuery and Snowflake have native support. MySQL has nothing official yet — you'd need to build custom functions or handle conversion in application code.

Benchmark your slowest geospatial query. Take whatever's currently killing performance and rewrite it using H3 functions. Measure the actual difference on real data volumes. One e-commerce company saw their "find nearby stores" query drop from 800ms to 120ms after migrating to H3 in November 2025. Your mileage varies, but you need real numbers to justify the investment.

Long-term strategy over the next six to twelve months:

Design for multi-resolution from day one. Store data at the appropriate resolution level for your primary use case, but architect systems to query across resolutions. A mapping application might display resolution 7 hexagons at country view, resolution 9 at city view, and resolution 11 when zoomed to street level. Build that flexibility into your schema and queries early.

Plan for mixed systems during transition. You probably can't migrate everything overnight. Most companies run hybrid architectures where new services use H3 while legacy systems stay on lat/lng. Build clean translation layers at service boundaries. Write functions that convert between formats. Document which systems use which approach. Accept that some legacy systems might stay on old coordinates indefinitely if migration costs outweigh benefits.

Invest in team education. Don't assume engineers will figure it out from documentation alone. Run internal workshops. Create visual tools showing hexagons overlaid on actual maps of your service area. Make resolution levels intuitive with concrete examples relevant to your business — "resolution 9 is roughly a neighborhood block in Manhattan" lands better than "resolution 9 is approximately 0.1 km²."

## The Opportunities and Obstacles Ahead

**Big opportunity: Privacy-compliant location analytics.** You can now aggregate user behavior at resolution 8 or 9 without storing personal GPS trails. This unlocks analytics that privacy regulations previously made risky or impossible. Retail chains can analyze foot traffic patterns without tracking individuals. Cities can study transportation flows. Insurance companies can assess neighborhood risk profiles. Build analytics products that explicitly market privacy protection. "We never see your exact location — only which general area you're in." That messaging resonates strongly in 2026's privacy-conscious market.

**Big challenge: The data migration trap.** Migrating millions of historical GPS records to H3 format isn't free. Index rebuilds take hours or days depending on data volume. Query rewrites introduce bugs that only surface in production. You'll need to run parallel systems during transition, which doubles infrastructure costs temporarily. One major delivery platform reported spending eight months on their core migration. They had to maintain both coordinate systems simultaneously, writing to both and gradually shifting read traffic. That's a serious commitment.

**Another opportunity: New product categories become feasible.** Real-time heat maps, dynamic pricing zones, predictive location services — these applications struggled badly with traditional coordinate systems. H3 makes them practically buildable. Expect a wave of location-intelligence startups in 2026-2027 built entirely on H3 foundations. If you're in the startup world, this is an enabling technology worth exploring. The infrastructure pieces finally exist to support products that weren't viable three years ago.

**Another challenge: The developer education gap.** Most engineering teams learned GIS the old way. H3 requires genuinely different thinking. The hexagonal mental model doesn't come naturally. Resolution level choices involve trade-offs that aren't obvious. Neighbor relationships work differently. That Stack Overflow question count — over 3,200 and growing — reflects real confusion. Companies underestimate how much internal training this requires. Budget time for your team to actually learn this stuff properly.

## What Happens Next

Near-term, watch for H3 support spreading to remaining major platforms. Microsoft Azure Maps hasn't announced integration yet. Neither has Oracle Spatial. Both will probably add support by Q3 2026 based on industry demand. The MySQL community might develop third-party extensions since official support continues lagging behind PostgreSQL.

More cities will adopt H3 for public services. Barcelona and Singapore launched pilot programs in late 2025 using H3 for emergency response dispatching. The results reportedly improved response time accuracy. Expect other municipalities to follow that pattern through 2026-2027.

Here's a potential game-changer: rumors suggest Apple is overhauling their mapping platform, possibly announcing in Q4 2026. Leaks indicate they might standardize on H3 for developer APIs. If iOS apps start using H3 hexagons as native location primitives — the way they currently use lat/lng coordinates — industry adoption would accelerate dramatically. Apple has the market power to shift defaults across the mobile ecosystem.

The truth is geospatial infrastructure evolves slowly, then suddenly. GPS coordinates dominated for roughly 30 years with incremental improvements. H3 might dominate the next 30. We're in the transition window right now. Companies investing in this shift during 2026 will likely set standards that everyone else follows in 2027-2028.

That window for early advantage closes pretty fast. If you handle location data professionally, H3 knowledge is becoming non-negotiable. The industry already shifted — 2026 is the year you either catch up or find yourself explaining why your queries run slower than competitors' and your privacy compliance costs more.

The infrastructure upgrade is happening. Your choice is whether to lead it, follow it quickly, or get dragged along later when migration becomes more painful. Based on cloud provider adoption and the benchmark data, the performance and privacy benefits are real enough to justify the learning curve.

Start small. Test with non-critical systems. Measure actual results. Then scale what works. That's how the major platforms did it. That's how your team can do it too.
