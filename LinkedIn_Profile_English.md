## About Section (2,600 characters max)

I design systems that reduce execution drag in product organizations.

Rather than producing more specs or running more meetings, I focus on identifying where teams lose time, clarity, or momentum — and build durable operating solutions, often using AI, that turn repeated human effort into systems.

**What I do:**
• Build AI-powered automation that eliminates repetitive work (Gmail→Jira parsing, natural-language data retrieval)
• Translate ambiguous regional requirements into scalable product systems
• Standardize fragmented processes across Product, Engineering, CS, Sales, and Data teams
• Bridge APAC markets (Korea/Japan) with global HQ teams

**Technical environment:**
Python, LLM APIs (Claude, Gemini), BigQuery/SQL, Jira/Linear, Slack integrations, GA4

**How I operate:**
I'm most effective in complex, multi-stakeholder environments where ownership is unclear, processes are fragmented, and execution speed matters. I operate comfortably across Product, Engineering, Customer Success, Sales, Data, and Leadership — and specialize in finding the 20% of process debt that causes 80% of the drag.

**Key results:**
• Revenue: +300% YoY (Send Anywhere ad revenue optimization)
• Conversion: +65% trial-to-paid (17% → 28%, enterprise segment)
• Efficiency: -18% onboarding time, -30% configuration time, -12% ticket volume
• Engagement: +20% CTR (Google Play Games)

**Background:**
Trilingual operator (Korean native, English fluent, Japanese business-level) with 6+ years bridging Korea/Japan markets and global teams. Experience spans consumer products (Send Anywhere, Rakuten Drive), platform products (Xsolla gaming payments), enterprise compliance (ISO 27001/27017), and marketplace operations (Google Play Games).

I believe the future of product work isn't writing better specs — it's building better operating systems for how teams work.

📫 Open to: Product leadership roles, AI-native product opportunities, technical PM positions
🌏 Location: Seoul, Korea (open to remote/hybrid for global teams)
