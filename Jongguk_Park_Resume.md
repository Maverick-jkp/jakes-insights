## SUMMARY

I design systems that reduce execution drag in product organizations. Rather than producing more specs or running more meetings, I focus on identifying where teams lose time, clarity, or momentum — and build durable operating solutions, often using AI, that turn repeated human effort into systems.

I operate comfortably across Product, Engineering, Customer Success, Sales, Data, and Leadership, and am most effective in complex, multi-stakeholder environments where ownership is unclear, processes are fragmented, and execution speed matters.

**Trilingual operator (KR/EN/JP)** with proven track record bridging APAC markets and global teams. Specialized in translating ambiguous regional requirements into scalable product systems while maintaining market context.

**Technical environment:** Python, LLM APIs (Claude, Gemini), BigQuery/SQL, Jira/Linear, Slack integrations, GA4
